# DOM Manipulation

## What is the DOM?
- The containers, buttons, and divs in the HTML represent the nodes of the DOM tree.
- The JavaScript dynamically accesses, creates, modifies, and removes these nodes, highlighting that DOM is a live object model of the HTML structure.

## DOM Manipulation Techniques
- Creating Elements:
    - Adding new DIVs using document.createElement and appendChild.
- Updating Content:
    - Modifying text using textContent.
- Styling/Classes:
    - Using classList.toggle to highlight all .myDiv elements.
- Removing Elements:
    - Deleting nodes using removeChild.
- Querying:
    - Using methods like getElementById and querySelectorAll to select elements.
- Viewing Current Structure:
    - Displaying the current containerâ€™s HTML to directly see updates in real-time.
